# I2C-driver for MS5637

Implements a driver for accessing an MS5637 temperature and pressure sensor.

The library is built to work with [`embedded-hal`] and has been tested on an
STM32L072 micro controller. The 1st-order temperature compensation is
implemented as per the [datasheet definition][ms5637], and inspired by the
implementation in the [Sparkfun MS5637 library][spk]. The 2nd-order temperature
compensation is probably wrong and untested, but may be activated using the
feature flag `second-order`. Additional height adjustment methods available in
the [Sparkfun library][spk] were copied over for convenience and may be enabled
using the `altitude-adjust` feature flag.

# Usage

Using the library is very easy, just provide something that can delay execution
by a specific time, and a reference to the I2C bus itself:

```
let mut ms5637 = ms5637::MS5637::new(&mut syst_delay, &mut i2c_bus);
let reading = ms5637.read_temperature_and_pressure_1st_order(&mut syst_delay, &mut i2c);
```

The library can be cooperatively used iwth other sensors on the same I2C-bus.
